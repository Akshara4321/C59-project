        <p class="para">My favourite hobby is music.I attend music classes too. I love music because it brings me into a completely new world. It feels magical and divine, the best feeling you could possibly imagine. While singing,I forget all the stress and pressure and grab happiness around me. It's wonderful and amazing.People usually say that only those who have talent can sing, but that's not true. Anyone can sing with just a little bit of work.That's what I love the most. You can express your emotions through singing too. Words are not always required.You can sing when you're happy , excited , sad , nervous etc. It makes you feel even better. It's just like a medicine.That is why singing is my favourite hobby. </p>
